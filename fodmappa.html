        <p>Course project<br>Role: UX Designer</p>
        <p> FODMAPPA is meant to be an app that allows people suffering from IBS find healthy, low-FODMAP foods for their diet and track the foods they are eating. There is an additional aspect that allows users to find coupons for low-FODMAP foods near them and connect with others who suffer from IBS to discuss problems they have in common. </p>
        <p>Software used: Adobe Illustrator, XD</p>

        <h1>Logo Creation</h1>
        <br>
        <p>AI began sketching logo concepts to begin. I developed a mock of the strawberry logo, before realizing that strawberries are, in fact, not a low-FODMAP food to begin with. So, I did further development on the book logo. However, I ran into some problems when it came to scaling because there were so many small details that were easy to forget. So upon further trial and error, I landed on the avocado style logo with a fork in it. It represents the general mission of the application, without providing too many details and still able to be scaled down.</p>

        <h1>Research</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Before diving into the actual UI, I did research on other similar food-related apps to see what could be done well, and what could be improved on things that already exist. In particular, I looked at Cara, which is a "food, mood, and poop tracker" available on mobile devices. <br> From Cara, I was able to find things that I thought shouldn't be included like confusing UI, unlabelled icons and graphs, and too bright of a color scheme. I was also able to draw inspiration from what worked well, such as easy to follow data visualization and displaying straightforward information that the user does not need to interpret.</p><br>
